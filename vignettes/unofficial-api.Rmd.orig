The unofficial or hidden API is essentially what the TikTok website uses to display you content.
Originally based on a translation of [Deen Freelon's `Pyktok` Python module](https://github.com/dfreelon/pyktok), `traktok` contains functions to simulate a browser accessing some of these API endpoints.
How these endpoints work was discovered through reverse engineering and TikTok might change how these endpoints operate at any moment.
As of writing this (2025-11-18), there are functions that can:

- search videos using a search term
- get video details and the video files from a given video URL
- get user videos
- get user info
- get who follows a user
- get who a user is following

To use these functions, you have to log into <tiktok.com> first and then give `R` the cookies the browser uses to identify itself.


# Authentication

The easiest way to get the cookies needed for authentication is to export the necessary cookies from your browser using a browser extension (after logging in at TikTok.com at least once).
I can recommend ["Get cookies.txt"](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc) for Chromium based browsers or ["cookies.txt"](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/) for Firefox (note that almost all browsers used today are based on one of these).

`r knitr::include_graphics("cookies.png")`

Save the cookies.txt file, which will look something like this:

```
# Netscape HTTP Cookie File
# https://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html
# This is a generated file! Do not edit.

.tiktok.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	1728810805	cookie-consent	{%22ga%22:true%2C%22af%...
.tiktok.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	1700471788	passport_csrf_token	e07d3487c11ce5258a3...
.tiktok.com	TRUE	/	FALSE	1700471788	passport_csrf_token_default	e07d3487c11...
#HttpOnly_.tiktok.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	1700493610	multi_sids	71573310862246389...
#HttpOnly_.tiktok.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	1700493610	cmpl_token	AgQQAPORF-RO0rNtH...
...
```

**It does not matter if you download all cookies or just the ones specific to TikTok**, as we use the `cookiemonster` package to deal with that.
To read the cookies into a specific encrypted file, simply use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
cookiemonster::add_cookies("tiktok.com_cookies.txt")
```

And that's it!
`traktok` will access these cookies whenever necessary.
To check if authentication was successful, you can use:

```{r}
auth_check()
```

# Usage
## Search videos

To search for videos, you can use either `tt_search` or `tt_search_hidden`, which do the same, as long as you do not have a token for the Research API.
The function opens a browser in the background (or you can see what is happening with `headless = TRUE`) and scrolls down.
Below, we let it scroll for up to one minute and solve captchas if they appear:

```{r tt_search_hidden}
rstats_df <- tt_search_hidden("#rstats", solve_captchas = TRUE, scroll = "1m")
rstats_df
```

![video of a captcha being solved](captcha.mp4)

This already gives you pretty much all information you could want about the videos that were found.

## Get metadata and download videos

If you already have URLs, you can obtain some more information, including the video files, using `tt_videos`:

```{r}
rstats_df2 <- tt_videos(rstats_df$video_url[1:2], save_video = TRUE)
rstats_df2
```

Per default, the function waits between one and ten seconds (chosen at random) between making two calls, to not make it too obvious that data is scraped from TikTok.
You can speed up the process (at your own risk), by changing the `sleep_pool` argument, which controls the minimum and maximum number of seconds to wait:

```{r}
rstats_df3 <- tt_videos(
  rstats_df$video_url[3:4],
  save_video = TRUE,
  sleep_pool = 0.1
)
rstats_df3
```

When you are scraping a lot of URLs, the function might fail eventually, due to a poor connection or because TikTok is blocking your requests.
It therefore usually makes sense to save your progress in a cache directory:

```{r}
rstats_df3 <- tt_videos(rstats_df$video_url[5:6], cache_dir = "rstats")
list.files("rstats")
```

Note that the video files are downloaded into the `dir` directory (your working directory by default), independently from your cache directory.

If there are information that you feel are missing from the `data.frame` `tt_videos` returns, you can look at the raw, unparsed json data using:

```{r eval=FALSE}
rstats_list1 <- tt_request_hidden(rstats_df$video_url[1]) |>
  jsonlite::fromJSON()
```

Parsing the result into a list using `fromJSON`, results in a rather complex nested list.
You can look through this and see for yourself if the data you are interested in is there

## Get followers and who a user is following

To get followers and who a user is following, we need to first look up their SecID, which is a special ID for users.
We can do so using the `tt_user_info_hidden` function:

```{r}
user_info <- tt_user_info_hidden("tiktok")
user_info$secUid
```

Once you have the `secUid` you can look up a maximum of 5,000 followers per account:

```{r}
tt_get_follower_hidden(
  secuid = "MS4wLjABAAAAwiH32UMb5RenqEN7duyfLIeGQgSIx9WtgtOILt55q6ueUXgz4gHqZC5HFx4nabPi",
  verbose = FALSE
)
```

Likewise, you can also check who this account follows:

```{r}
tt_get_following_hidden(
  secuid = "MS4wLjABAAAAwiH32UMb5RenqEN7duyfLIeGQgSIx9WtgtOILt55q6ueUXgz4gHqZC5HFx4nabPi",
  verbose = FALSE
)
```


```{r include=FALSE}
list.files(pattern = ".mp4") |>
  unlink()
unlink("rstats", recursive = TRUE)
```
