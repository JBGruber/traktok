last_query()

last_comments()
}
\value{
a list of unparsed videos or comments.
}
\description{
If \code{tt_search_api} or \code{tt_comments_api} fail after already getting
several pages, you can use this function to get all videos that have been
retrieved so far from memory. Does not work when the session has crashed. In
that case, look in \code{tempdir()} for an RDS file as a last resort.
