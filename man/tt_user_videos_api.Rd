  Get all videos posted by a user or multiple user's. This is a convenience
  wrapper around \code{\link{tt_search_api}} that takes care of moving time
  windows (search is limited to 30 days). This is the version of
  \link{tt_user_videos} that explicitly uses Research API. Use
  \link{tt_user_videos_hidden} for the unofficial API version.

# Get videos from the user "fpoe_at" since October 2024
tt_user_videos_api("fpoe_at", since = "2024-10-01")

# hidden URL
fpoe_at_info <- tt_user_info_hidden(username = "fpoe_at")
tt_user_videos_api("fpoe_at", since = fpoe_at_info$create_time)
