  This is the version of \link{tt_search} that explicitly uses unofficial
  API. Use \link{tt_search_api} for the Research API version.
}
\details{
The function will wait between scraping two videos to make it less
  obvious that a scraper is accessing the site. The period is drawn randomly
  from the `sleep_pool` and multiplied by a random fraction.
