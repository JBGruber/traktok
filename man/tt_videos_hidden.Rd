\arguments{
\item{video_urls}{vector of URLs to TikTok videos.}

\item{save_video}{logical. Should the videos be downloaded.}

\item{overwrite}{logical. If save_video=TRUE and the file already exists,
should it be overwritten?}

\item{dir}{directory to save videos files to.}

\item{cache_dir}{if set to a path, one RDS file with metadata will be written
to disk for each video. This is useful if you have many videos and want to
pick up where you left if something goes wrong.}

\item{sleep_pool}{a vector of numbers from which a waiting period is randomly
drawn.}

\item{max_tries}{how often to retry if a request fails.}

\item{cookiefile}{path to your cookiefile. See
\code{vignette("unofficial-api", package = "traktok")} for more information
on authentication.}

\item{verbose}{should the function print status updates to the screen?}

\item{...}{handed to \code{tt_videos_hidden} (for tt_videos) and (further) to
\link{tt_request_hidden}.}

\details{
The function will wait between scraping two videos to make it less
  obvious that a scraper is accessing the site. The period is drawn randomly
  from the `sleep_pool` and multiplied by a random fraction.

Note that the video file has to be requested in the same session as
  the metadata. So while the URL to the video file is included in the
  metadata, this link will not work in most cases.
